*The LifeOS that redefines creation, collaboration, and ownership.*

---

# 🌐 The Problem Space
- Fragmented productivity tools
- No unified creative ecosystem
- Ownership and value often lost in collaboration

---

# 🚀 What is Vylyrian?
- A graph-based, plugin-powered **Life Operating System**
- Dynamic interfaces, modular architecture
- Contributors earn credit through BIP-based ownership

---

# 🧱 Architecture Overview
### Dual Data Engine:
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data
- **Neo4j** for dynamic graph relationships
- **SQLite** for offline caching

---

# 🔌 Plugin-Driven UI
- Built with **Blazor** + **WASM**
- DI handled by **Lamar**
- Components registered by `ComponentId`
- Context-aware rendering from graph data

---

# 📡 GraphQL API Layer
- Unified access to relational + graph data
- Offline snapshot generation
- Real-time UI reflection via graph mutations

---

# 🧠 Dynamic Rendering System
- No static menus or views
- UI builds itself from node metadata
- Real-time updates with user interactions

```

---

# 🎮 Gamification & Mythos
- User ranks: **Apprentice → Master → Grand Master**
- Identity system embedded in progression
- Interactive storytelling through system use

---

# 🪙 Ownership & Tokenization
- **Basis Points (BIPs)** track creative value
- Internal credit system
- Optional tokenization for revenue events

---

# 📱 Vylyr: The First Experience
- Personalized, scrollable brandstory feed
- Content meets commerce
- Feeds filtered by **emotion**, **identity**, and **mythos**

---

# 🛠️ Roadmap
1. Core Graph + Plugin Engine
2. Dynamic UI Rendering
3. Marketplace + Internal Economy
4. Collaborative HollywoodOS

---

# 🎁 Join the Graph
> "Contribute. Create. Become a part of the graph."
- Developers
- Creators
- Explorers
